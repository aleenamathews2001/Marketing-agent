Field: Start_Date__c
Description: The date when the contact's employment/role started at the company. CRITICAL FOR FILTERING CURRENTLY WORKING EMPLOYEES: Use this field with End_Date__c to identify active employees. A contact is currently working if: Start_Date__c <= TODAY AND (End_Date__c = null OR End_Date__c >= TODAY). Example SOQL: WHERE Start_Date__c <= TODAY AND (End_Date__c = null OR End_Date__c >= TODAY). This is NOT related to CampaignMember.Status which tracks email campaign engagement.

================================================================================
Field: End_Date__c
Description: The date when the contact's employment/role ends at the company. CRITICAL FOR FILTERING CURRENTLY WORKING EMPLOYEES: If this field is NULL/blank, the contact is still employed (ongoing). If End_Date__c < TODAY, the contact is no longer working. If End_Date__c >= TODAY, they are still employed. To find currently working contacts, use: WHERE (End_Date__c = null OR End_Date__c >= TODAY) AND Start_Date__c <= TODAY. This is NOT related to CampaignMember.Status which tracks email campaign engagement (Sent/Responded/Draft).
